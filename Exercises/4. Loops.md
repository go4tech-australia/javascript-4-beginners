# Loops

In [index.js](../src/index.js):

### Exercise 1.

Calling `moveSnake` manually becomes tedious. Lets automate it my using a loop. Using a `for` loop to call `moveSnake` three times to move in one direction then with another loop move three times in another direction.

(Optional) Try the same thing but using a `while` loop.

### Exercise 2.

a. Loops run really fast. Lets slow it down by using the `GAME.loop()` function, which will run every second. You can increase the speed by passing in a number to `GAME.loop()`.

b. To move the snake while the loop is running pass `moveSnake` to `GAME.onArrowKey()`.
