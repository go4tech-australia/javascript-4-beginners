# Variables

In [index.js](../src/index.js):

### Exercise 1.

a. Create a variable `myName` and assign it a value of your name.

b. Display your name by passing `myName` to the `alert()` function.

Open index.html. Your name should appear in the alert box.

**HINT:** If your name is made up of alphabetical characters remember to wrap your name in double quotations. This is called a [string](https://www.javascript.com/learn/strings).

**PRO TIP:** In your browser, press `CTRL + SHIFT + I` to open dev tools. Click on the network tab in opened dev tools to see all your console logs, errors and more information.
