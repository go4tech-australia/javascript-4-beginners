# Exercises

The following exercises compliment the lessons found in the [lessons](../Lessons/) fodlder.

Attempt each lesson by yourself and if you get stuck, you can ask your mentor for help. The lessons build off each other so it is best to do them in order.

All lessons should be written the [index.js](../src/index.js) file found in the [src](../src/) folder. To run your code, open the [index.html](../src/index.html) file in your browser.
