**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

```javascript
for (var step = 0; step < 5; step = step + 1) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4
  console.log('Walking east step number:' + step);
}
```

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero).

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement
